# Word-Guess-CLI

- This is a Word Guess command-line game and its similar to the 80's Hangman-Style game which runs on a web browser.

- This app was created using constructor functions from word.js and letter.js to the index.js file which actually runs the game through thier npm dependencies.

- This app runs on node.js and user is expected to make a guess from the computer array of different word choices randomly selected with a method called math.floor in JavaScript.

- If all guessed letter is eqaul to computer choice the user wins and the game restarts with a different word to guess as demostrated below.
